## Introduction

JSONPlaceholder is a fake REST API that provides mock data for testing and learning purposes. This Angular project demonstrates how to interact with JSONPlaceholder APIs to retrieve and display datasets such as posts, comments, users, albums, photos, and todos.

## Features

- Displaying lists of posts, comments, users, albums, photos, and todos.
- Fetching data from JSONPlaceholder using Angular's HttpClient.
- Utilizing Angular's components, services, and data binding features.
- Providing TypeScript interfaces for improved type safety.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or create a new Angular project on StackBlitz.
2. Navigate to the relevant components (e.g., `src/app/posts`, `src/app/comments`, etc.).
3. Replace the component content with your own logic to fetch and display JSONPlaceholder data.
4. Use Angular's HttpClient to make GET requests to JSONPlaceholder endpoints.
5. Leverage the provided TypeScript interfaces for structured data handling.

Example: Fetching and displaying posts in `posts.component.ts`:
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { JsonPlaceholderService } from '../jsonplaceholder.service';
import { Post } from '../interfaces';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-posts',
  templateUrl: './posts.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./posts.component.css']
})
export class PostsComponent implements OnInit {
  posts: Post[] = [];

  constructor(private jsonPlaceholderService: JsonPlaceholderService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.jsonPlaceholderService.getPosts().subscribe(posts => {
      this.posts = posts;
    });
  }
}
```

6. Customize the UI, styles, and additional features as needed.
7. Run the app using `ng serve` or on StackBlitz.
